                <p>My name is Vince Wolfe and I am 27 years old. I was born and raised in Denver, CO. Till recently
                    discovering my passion for programming I've been working for the City of Thornton for just under 5
                    years as a heavy equipment operator II. My plan is to learn as much about programming as I can to
                    secure a position as a Jr Web-Developer; from there I plan to continue learning and developing my
                    skill set. I love that there will always be something to learn and that there are always new
                    tools(Frameworks/Languages/updates) to use which brings a challange I enjoy. Programming is my
                    passion; with continued dedication and consistency I will learn what it takes to become a top notch
                    Software Engineer. </p>

                <p>I've attended multiple courses provided by Galvanize to learn and sharpen my knowledge about
                    programming. I learned basic HTML along with CSS and an introductionn to Javascript. While there I
                    was also introduced to the command line.</p>

                <h3>Self taught</h3>
                <h6>Learned to program from various sources on my own</h6>
                <p>After going to a few "learn to code" classes I found my passion for programming and my love for
                    it
                    has taken off since. I've spent my early mornings, nights, and weekends studying and
                    implementing
                    coding into my life. Learning as much as I can from resources such as Udemy, Udacity,
                    SoloLearn,
                    YoutTube, and networking with students/staff at Galvanize; my knowledge has grown
                    significantlly in
                    the past few months and it continues to grow. I'm facinated with the endless possibilities of
                    what
                    you can create with so many different tools available to the Developer. I began to enjoy
                    problem
                    solving because it leads to a full understanding of why things work and why other dont. </p>

                <h6>Personal/Freelance</h6>
                <p>Most of my experience has been with personal projects that you can view in the "My work" section of
                    this portfolio. I've built most of my projects with an HTML and CSS base with some projects
                    containing Javascript; which I am currently learning. I'm currently working on a freelance project
                    for a client who is a personal trainer.</p>
